## 🎨 Production Tips

### Visual Polish
1. **Clean Your Browser**: Close unnecessary tabs, hide bookmarks bar
2. **Cursor Highlighting**: Use a cursor highlighter tool for better visibility
3. **Smooth Movements**: Move cursor slowly and deliberately
4. **Pause Between Actions**: Give viewers time to see changes (1-2 seconds)
5. **Zoom In**: For form inputs, zoom browser to 110-125% for better readability

### Audio Tips (If Adding Voiceover)
1. **Use a Good Microphone**: Built-in laptop mics work, but external is better
2. **Quiet Environment**: Record in a quiet room
3. **Speak Clearly**: Moderate pace, enthusiastic tone
4. **Script Practice**: Read script 2-3 times before recording
5. **Edit Out Mistakes**: Use video editing software to cut errors

### Alternative: Silent Demo with Text Overlays
If you prefer no voiceover:
- Add text overlays explaining each feature
- Use smooth transitions between scenes
- Add subtle background music (royalty-free)
- Include feature callouts with arrows/highlights
